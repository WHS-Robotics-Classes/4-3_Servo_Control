# Arduino 4.3 - Servo Control
## The SG90 Servo is a simple three-wire servo that is simple to use.  For this assignment you will need to review how to add a library to the Codebender app.

### Step One: Build the Circuit

Build your circuit according to this schematic:

### Step Two: Write the Code

Be sure you have used the "Servo" library that comes with the Codebender.edu app we use in class.  After testing it out, revise the code to do the following:



### Step Three: Debug and Submit

Make sure your prototype behaves the same way as the demo in class. *Make three new files and commit them to this repository on GitHub*. Name them as follows:

    - 4.1-L298N-1.ino
    - 4.1-L298N-2.ino
    - 4.1-L298n-3.ino
